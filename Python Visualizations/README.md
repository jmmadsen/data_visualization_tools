# Python Visualizations

Python is often used for data science and visualization. Two foundational libraries most often used are Pandas and Matplotlib.

Pandas is the most popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis. You can load CSV, Excel, JSON, and other data sources into the library for further cleansing, organization, and manipulation. It offers plenty of built in functions for your data including grouping, ordering, slicing, and other more advanced techniques.

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. It provides a GUI of your graphs once you supply your finalized data to the API. You can read more about its documentation <a href="https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
